Title: Car Dealership Sales Performance Dashboard report and prediction model
Description:
A compact, action‑oriented dashboard that blends historical sales with short‑term forecasts to help a car dealership track performance, spot spikes and dips, and plan inventory and staffing with confidence.

The top KPI strip highlights average monthly value, total monthly value, and the active account count for a quick health check before drilling into trends or segments.

Time‑series visuals show monthly sales across years and month‑over‑month change, making seasonality and sudden movements easy to see at a glance.

Forecast panels project monthly values and expected MoM% changes with visible uncertainty, giving an early view of risk and upside in the coming months.

Segmentation views rank Top 10 and Bottom 10 accounts and summarize Top‑10 vs Others, focusing attention on the biggest growth levers and recovery opportunities.

An interactive accounts table supports validation and drill‑downs from summary insights to individual accounts for follow‑up actions and sharing with teams.
